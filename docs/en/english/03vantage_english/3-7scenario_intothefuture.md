## Problem of mine

    a. analyze result : Grammar is only being used when I'm expressing something in my brain.  
    b. analyze result : However, when I'm reading, grammar isn't a main part of what I'd check.  
    c. analyze result : I'm not familliar with common phrases and combinding expressions in use, like `a lot less cash`.  
2. Modal verbs can express a range of meaning.
